The Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence was proclaimed from Chittagong by members of the Mukti Bahiniâ€”the national liberation army formed by <b> Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians.</b> The East Bengal Regiment and the East Pakistan Rifles played a crucial role in the resistance. Led by General M. A. G. Osmani and eleven sector commanders, the Bangladesh Forces waged a mass guerrilla war against the Pakistani military. They liberated numerous towns and cities in the initial months of the conflict. <h1>The Pakistan Army regained momentum in the monsoon.</h1> Bengali guerrillas carried out widespread sabotage, including Operation Jackpot against the Pakistan Navy. <h2>The nascent Bangladesh Air Force flew sorties against Pakistani military bases.</h2>By November, the Bangladesh forces restricted the Pakistani military to its barracks during the night.<h3><strong>They secured control of most parts of the countryside.[22]</strong></h3>
